# Level One Show Website v2.1 - Licensing Information

## Project Status & Code Use:
At the current moment, this website is on indefinite hold. There are some tentative plans to recycle some of the code for other projects (even in the event of the website project being restarted).

As to why I listed this project as NonCommercial, I would prefer not to go into those reasons. All I would like to say is that I would like to retain some autonomy with this code.

### Volta Network Usage:
I am giving express permission that the Volta Network, as an entity, has **secondary** priority over the code I have written. Priority usage of the code goes to the creator of the code (as named below).

All other uses of the code are tertiary.
