This is a version of the streaming backend that uses a semi-functional websockets server and client. I don't plan on updating this. I am just using this as a backup.

For licensing information, refer to [the README](https://github.com/VoltaNetwork/Volta-Streaming-Server/blob/master/README.md) on the master branch.
