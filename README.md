![Logo](http://i.imgur.com/FDQOtJr.png)

This is a version of the streaming service backend that has integration with hitbox. 
It hasn't been tested fully and given Hitbox's API, I am unable to get the title of the stream, 
which is a feature that was request that this service include.

For licensing information, refer to [the README](https://github.com/VoltaNetwork/Volta-Streaming-Server/blob/master/README.md) on the master branch.
