Todo:

Wave 1:
- Finish Beam integration (DONE)
- Finish outside-layer json compiler (DONE).
- Tornado Server (DONE).
- Add hitbox integration (DONE; some features missing).
- Finish API server (DONE).
- Finish DOM Generation.

Wave 2:
- Add the ability to enroll keys for API. Keys will become mandatory after this point.
- Rewrite streams.py to be asynchronous.
- Twitter bot as demonstration of API.
- Add real-time push updates (possible webworker push updates in Chrome).
- Multithread experiment.
- Add YouTube Gaming integration (again, depends on the API).

Sample Data Output:
[{"name": user, "title": title, "url": link}, {"name": user, "title": title, "url": link}, ...]

Server File Structure:
../main.py 
../streams.py
../html/home.template.html
../html2/index.html 	|
../html2/api_data.txt	| <- so that I can serve data to API until integrated into Tornado.

Website Structure:
/ <- Homepage (home.template.html)
/api <- API requests
/api/enroll <- Enroll new keys for API (currently there is no system for this so it redirects to /).
